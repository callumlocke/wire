/**
 * Returns an async transform that, when passed a filemap, runs your callback once for every file. Your callback decides what to output for the given input file â€“ it may output the file as-is, or a buffer/string of new contents to replace the file, or `null` to exclude that file from the output, or a plain object detailing multiple files to output instead of the original file.
 *
 * The returned transform retains an internal memo of which output files were triggered by which input files on each invocation. It uses this, in combination with a diff comparing the incoming filemap to the incoming filemap from the previous invocation, to determine which files actually need to be built again after a change (even if the change was to an included file, rather than the file itself). In many cases it's just one or two files, and their results are simply combined with the output from the previous invocation.
